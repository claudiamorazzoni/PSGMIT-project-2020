#### In 1936 Ronald Fisher, biologist and statistician presented a set of data. It is sometimes called Anderson's Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species.

### The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris Setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor).

### Four features were measured in centimeters from each sample: 
###### - the length of the sepals
###### - the width of the sepals
###### - the length of the petals
###### - the width of the petals

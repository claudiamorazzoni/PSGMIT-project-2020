## About

#### This is an example of a notebook to demonstrate concepts of Data Science. The dataset is often used in data mining, classification and clustering examples and to test algorithms.

In 1936 Ronald Fisher, biologist and statistician presented a set of data. It is sometimes called Anderson's Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species.

The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris Setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor). Just for reference, here are pictures of the three flowers species:

Four features were measured in centimeters from each sample: 
* the length of the sepals
* the width of the sepals
* the length of the petals
* the width of the petals
